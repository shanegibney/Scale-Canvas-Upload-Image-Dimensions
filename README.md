# Scale Canvas Uploaded Image Dimensions

The intention is to be able to measure distances on an image relative to an initially marked known distance.

gh-pages [demo](https://shanegibney.github.io/Scale-Canvas-Upload-Image-Dimensions/)

How to use the tool:
* Upload an image to the canvas, ideally a line drawing
* Left click to mark the beginning of a know distance on the image
* Left click again to mark the end of the known distance
* An input box will appear into which you should put the known distance
* Again mark any two points
* And again an input box will appear. This time input a name for this dimension.
* The name of this dimension and distance will appear both on the canvas and along the left side of the page.
* You can also set constraint so that you can only draw either horizontal or vertical lines.
* Using the 'Save as' dropdown menu, to save the canvas as a .png image
* Or save as a .scad file of variables for [openSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).
* Or save as a .txt file of the variables for general use.
